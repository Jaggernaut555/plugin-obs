# OBS Plugin

Currently this is a proof-of-concept plugin to show some practical usage of [midi-mixer-plugin](https://github.com/midi-mixer/midi-mixer-plugin). It provides an exceedingly basic OBS integration by adding a list of all sources to your MIDI Mixer assignments list and button types for switching between scenes.

## Usage

1. Download and install [obs-websocket](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-obs-studio-from-websockets.466/) for OBS
2. [Download the plugin](https://github.com/midi-mixer/plugin-obs/releases/latest)
3. Open the `.MidiMixerPlugin` file with midi mixer
