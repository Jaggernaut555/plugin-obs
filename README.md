# OBS Plugin

Currently this is a proof-of-concept plugin to show some practical usage of [midi-mixer-plugin](https://github.com/midi-mixer/midi-mixer-plugin). It provides an exceedingly basic OBS integration by adding a list of all sources to your MIDI Mixer assignments list and button types for switching between scenes.

## Usage

1. [Download the plugin](https://github.com/midi-mixer/plugin-obs/archive/main.zip)
2. Extract the `plugin-obs-main` folder to `%appdata%/midi-mixer-app/plugins`

For more information on how this plugin was made (or to make your own) check out [midi-mixer-plugin](https://github.com/midi-mixer/midi-mixer-plugin) and the [midi-mixer/plugin-template](https://github.com/midi-mixer/plugin-template) repository.
